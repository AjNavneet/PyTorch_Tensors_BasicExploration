# PyTorch Tensors basics

## Overview

PyTorch, developed by Facebook (Meta), is a leading open-source deep learning framework. It provides a robust machine learning library with GPU support, making it efficient for developing deep learning models. PyTorch tensors are akin to Numpy arrays, but with built-in GPU support, offering fast and efficient computation. Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that serve as the fundamental building blocks for various machine learning algorithms.

In this project, we delve into PyTorch and its tensor operations. We explore the essential concepts and operations related to PyTorch tensors, laying the groundwork for mastering deep learning with PyTorch.
